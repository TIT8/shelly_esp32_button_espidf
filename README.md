# Native ESP code for Shelly's toggle button
‚ùó [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/) version of the Arduino repo: https://github.com/TIT8/shelly_button_esp32_arduino

## Description

A push button is connected to the [ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) microcontroller. When its state changes, it will trigger an [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) publish which will toggle the light controlled by a [`Shelly plus 1 relay`](https://www.shelly.com/en-it/products/product-overview/shelly-plus-1). 

‚ùóKeep in mind that you should either use a capacitor (better) or providing some delay in the code to debounce the push button and filter out spurious changes. Pull down the push button via a 10k resistor, **if you don't set the pull-up mode on the input pin**.

- For testing I use the [Hive MQ public broker](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/public-mqtt-broker/).

- For production I use [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) from a Docker container inside my local environment (see the [Docker compose file](https://github.com/TIT8/shelly_button_esp32/blob/master/compose.yaml)).


## Prerequisities

- Look at the [PlatformIO documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/tutorials/espressif32/espidf_debugging_unit_testing_analysis.html) to start.
- If you already have the ESP-IDF installed (via Platformio or not), all the dependencies come with it, so you won't import anything. Simply build and upload üí™.


## ESP-IDF vs Arduino

| Features | ESP-IDF | Arduino |
| :-------- | ---- | ----- |
| Dependencies | All included in the official SDK | <ul><li>ArduinoJson</li><li>Pubsubclient</li></ul> |
| Clear advantage | Extreme control on execution contexts | Portability of code to other Arduino compatible board |
! JSON response | Handled via cJSON (well maintained) | Handled via ArduinoJson (wrapper of cJSON) |
| MQTT features | <ul><li>Well maintained library</li><li>QoS 0,1,2 on publish and subscribe</li><li>Ability to have multiple client</li><li>MQTT over Websocket and SSL/TLS</li><li>MQTT 5 also available</li></ul> | <ul><li>Unmaintained library</li><li>QoS 0 on publish and QoS 0, 1 on subscribe</li><li>MQTT 3 only</li><li>MQTT over Websocket and SSL/TLS not available</li><li>Work on board of different manufacturers</li></ul> |
| GPIO pin handling | Same as Arduino, but more control on interrupt ISR and FreeRTOS queue | Easieast to start, you know... ‚ù§Ô∏è |
| OTA updates | Great flexibility, but difficult to start without strong motivation | Less flexibility, but easy to get the job done |
